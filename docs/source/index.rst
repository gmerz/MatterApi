Welcome to MatterApi's Documentation
========================================================

A python client library for accessing the Mattermost API with sync/async support.

.. warning:: Be aware that this library is autogenerated from the API documentation. And the documentation is not *perfect*. There
   are still the occasional hiccups which might result in wrong handling of e.g. return values

Getting Started
---------------

The client has synch and async support. Depending on your workflow you will want to choose between
the :doc:`client/sync_client` and :doc:`client/async_client`.

Take a look at :doc:`/getting_started` to get an example of how to use them in your projects.

Credits

Credits where credits are due:

+ This library is autogenerated from the Mattermost API documentation using a fork of `openapi-python-client <https://github.com/triaxtec/openapi-python-client>`_. 
+ It's heavily inspired by (but not a 1:1 drop-in replacement for) `mattermostclient <https://github.com/Vaelor/python-mattermost-driver>`_, which I used for several years already. This is your go-to if you look for something stable.
